"Criptomonedas" is an application to quote a currency with some cryptocurrency. It was created with React Native and TypeScript. The application is lightweight and its operation relies on consulting an API in real time. Using a form (Exchange currency [USD] - Currency to consult [Bitcoin]), it returns the current value, the highest and lowest value of the day and the price variation of the last 24 hours.
